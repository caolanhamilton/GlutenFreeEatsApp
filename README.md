# Gluten Free Eats App
Gluten Free Eats is an iOS and Android app that allows sufferers of celiac disease and gluten intolerance to crowdsource safe places to dine out. People with celiac disease and gluten intolerance often have different requirements about the acceptable level of cross-contamination. This app allows people to only see restaurants which are 100% gluten-free or to view restaurants that serve gluten but which other users believe to be safe places to eat. 

## Features
 - See a crowd-sourced list of suitable places to eat
 - Filter by distance from your current location
 - Plan ahead by setting a location manually and viewing the top places to eat near it
 - Add new locations to the app to help others
 - Leave reviews of places you have visited
 - Favourite locations
 - See curated lists such as dedicated gluten-free spots, top-rated spots or places with high community safety scores

## Technologies used
The core technology used to build the app was React Native with the Expo framework. The majority of the styling in the app uses [Tailwind CSS React Native](https://tailwindcss-react-native.vercel.app/).  Calls to the back-end API are made using Axios and user authentication on the front-end uses Firebase.
